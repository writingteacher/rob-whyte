#### About    
Rob has been writing professionally for 25+ years. Fresh out of graduate school with an M.Sc. in urban planning, he wrote technical reports for an environmental consultancy in Toronto. Eager to explore the world, he moved to Asia, which is where the Wheel of Fortuna showed her hand.

He honed his professional writing chops as a Lonely Planet author, learned the art of simplifying instructions as a teacher, and assembled a digital toolbox as an online content creator and ebook writer.

At the intersection of that experience, Rob comes to technical writing with an ear for plain English communication, a head for breaking down complex operations, and an eye for SaaS documentation that reduces user friction.
