## On the road from teacher to tech writer. It's a bumpy ride.

I write user face docs that help people learn skills and complete tasks.

Help SaaS startups build their knowledge base, write SEO marketing content, and other reports like white papers, lead magnets, or explainer videos. Add value by transforming information into accessible document solutions written in plain English.
